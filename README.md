# quizzler

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
This project demonstrates the implementation of core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using Flutter.

Encapsulation is applied to protect internal quiz logic and prevent direct access to quiz questions and state, ensuring better control over data flow.

The project explains and demonstrates the use of the Expanded widget to create responsive layouts.

It also showcases the effective use of buttons to handle user interactions and trigger application logic.

Overall, this project focuses on writing clean, modular, and maintainable Flutter code while reinforcing fundamental OOP principles.
